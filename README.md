# algorithms

This is where I learn more algorithms and practice implementing them in differnet languages. 

Languages: 
J - Java (Eclipse IDE)
S - Scala (Eclipse IDE)
P - Python (Emacs + Python 2.7.10)
C - C++ (Emacs)
Pe - Perl
Ruby
PHP
Bash
Zsh
AWK
Tcl/Tk

| ---- | Insertion Sort | 
| ---- | Merge Sort | 
| ---- | Merge Sort for Linked Lists | 
| ---- | Heap Sort |
| ---- | Quick Sort |

Note: I started this because I thought it would be fun and now I'm realising my necessity of working on this because if I don't practice the languages I learned then I forget them!!!
