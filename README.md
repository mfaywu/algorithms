# algorithms

This is where I learn more algorithms and practice implementing them in differnet languages. 

Languages: 
Java (Eclipse)
Scala (Eclipse)
Python 
C++

|      | Insertion Sort | 
|      | Merge Sort | 
|      | Merge Sort for Linked Lists | 
|      | Heap Sort |
|      | Quick Sort |
|      | Radix Sort |
|      | Counting Sort |
|      | Bucket Sort |
|      | Shell Sort |
|      | Comb Sort |

Note: I started this because I thought it would be fun and now I'm realising my necessity of working on this because if I don't practice the languages I learned then I forget them!!!
